# Effective-Lecture-Scheduling-and-Reporting-System
This project is creating as my university mini project. 

Target outcomes are convenient lecture planning, maintaining good communication among faculty staff and batches of students, efficient report generating, and an accessible online notice board. The system consists of a user-friendly GUI for users to handle and access the information of the lectures, reports, and notices. This system provides accurate and timely data to users.

In here I used MERN stack technologies collection that enables faster application development. The main purpose of using MERN stack is to develop app using JavaScript only.
